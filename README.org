* README
This is the code repository of the "SuperLearner vs clinicians" (working title)
study. The bulk of the code is in [[./R]], but testing can and perhaps should, be
performed from [[playground.r]], located here in the top directory. The main
function is [[./R/make.study.r][make.study.r]], which calls, either directly or indirectly, the
functions in remaining .r files.

** To test and review code
1. Start with [[./playground.r][playground.r]].
2. Run the first lines to source all functions in [[./R]].
3. The remaining content of playground.r is more or less a copy of make.study.r

** To contribute
Make sure to read our [[./todo.org][todo]]. Do a git log. Contribute new functions as a new file.
